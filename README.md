# **SIMPLE-ETL-ON-ADVENTURE-WORK-USING-SSIS**

This project aims to provide a basic solution for anyone who is building a new ETL pipeline using SSIS. The project involves building an ETL pipeline on the AdventureWorks database using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

# **Prerequisites**


# *Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed:

Visual Studio 2019 (Note: Visual Studio 2017 works slightly different regarding SSIS and this article may not work exactly for Visual Studio 2017)
SQL Server


# **Installation and Setup

Clone the repository or download the zip file.
The solution contains three projects:
Open the Package.dtsx file and update the connection strings to match your SQL Server configuration.
Build the solution to ensure all projects build successfully.
Deploy the AdventureWorksETL project to the SQL Server Integration Services Catalog.
Execute the deployed SSIS package to perform the ETL process.

# **Conclusion
This project provides a simple ETL solution for anyone looking to build an ETL pipeline using SSIS. The AdventureWorks database was used as a reference, but the SSIS package can be modified to work with any other database.
